[Illustration: _PREFACE._

_Science is very good in its own way, but we observe a wide-spread and
lamentable ignorance concerning all that pertains to the romantic side
of our earth’s history. It is to dispel this ignorance that the
following facts are made public._]




I. [Illustration]


One summer’s night, about a million years ago, it happened that the Moon
was pensive.




II. [Illustration]


It also happened that the Earth was floating leisurely about in space as
if he thought himself a thing of beauty. But she affected not to see
him.




III. [Illustration]


Old Saturn did, however, and understood it all. For æons he had loved
this Moon, but she had chilled him to the marrow whenever he
approached.




IV. [Illustration]


When he saw the Earth go nearer and nearer, and finally sit beside her,
and even then get nearer still and tell her something in an earnest
manner, and she enjoy it all, his spirit boiled within him.




V. [Illustration]


He swore to spoil the fun, then burst upon them in a fury.

High words ensued.




VI. [Illustration]


And trouble followed.

They had an ugly fight, tearing about the Heavens for hours, bumping
into other Planets, and deranging the whole solar system.




VII. [Illustration]


But the Earth was a lusty boy, and finally got in a scorching blow
between the old beau’s eyes that sent him whirling into space.




VIII. [Illustration]


And never since has he annoyed the Moon.




IX. [Illustration]


While this was going on, the Sun, also a lover of the Moon, had risen
with the dawn, as usual, and prepared for his morning drive.




X. [Illustration]


As he approached the scene of all this trouble he took in the situation
at a glance, and at once made a formal offer of marriage.

But she declined respectfully, saying she was already promised to the
Earth.




XI. [Illustration]


But Sol was hot-headed, and not accustomed to defeat.

He carried her off by main force, and said, “If ever I see you and the
Earth together, I will burn you both to a cinder!”




XII. [Illustration]


So it is only while the Sun is sleeping that she can see her lover.

’Tis then she steals away.




XIII. [Illustration]


She hovers over him at night, and her tears that fall upon the Earth are
what we call the dew.
